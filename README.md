# Open Course Materials in Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Beyond

This repository is maintained by **Diaeddin Rimawi** (<dmrimawi@gmail.com>).  
It contains teaching materials developed by me, sometimes in collaboration with colleagues, in the fields of Computer Science, Software Engineering, and related areas (including soft skills in the future). All content is provided for free reuse.

**Important notice.** The materials may contain errors and there is room for improvement. Please consider this while using them, and feel free to propose corrections through pull requests or issues.

The repository organizes each course in its own folder. Inside each course folder, weekly materials are provided as `README.md` files, together with any supplementary files.
