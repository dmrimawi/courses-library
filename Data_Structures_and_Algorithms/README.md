# Data Structures and Algorithms

**Authors.** Diaeddin Rimawi (<dmrimawi@gmail.com>), Refat Othman (<ref3tothman@gmail.com>)  
**Dependency.** Programming Fundamentals and Object-Oriented Programming in Python

## Overview

This course introduces core data structures and algorithms with an emphasis on rigorous thinking and practical implementation. Each week includes one 2-hour lecture and one 2-hour exercise session, together with one assignment that is due the following week.

**Intended learning outcomes.**
- Analyze algorithmic complexity at a high level and reason about trade-offs.
- Implement fundamental data structures including linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, graphs, and hash tables.
- Apply classic algorithms for sorting, searching, path finding, and compression.
- Select appropriate data structures for given problem constraints and performance goals.

**Prerequisites.** Programming Fundamentals and Object-Oriented Programming in Python, or equivalent.

Each week provides:
1. A `README.md` summarizing the lecture topics and learning objectives,
2. Exercise prompts designed for a 2-hour lab session,
3. An assignment that is due in the following week.
