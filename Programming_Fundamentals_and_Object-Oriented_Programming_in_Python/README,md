# Programming Fundamentals and Object-Oriented Programming in Python

**Authors.** Diaeddin Rimawi (<dmrimawi@gmail.com>), Refat Othman (<ref3tothman@gmail.com>)

## Overview

This course introduces fundamental computational thinking and core Python programming concepts, followed by object-oriented programming. Each week includes one 2-hour lecture and one 2-hour exercise session, together with one assignment that is due the following week. A final project consolidates the learning outcomes.

**Intended learning outcomes.**
- Write clear and correct Python programs using variables, control flow, functions, and files.
- Apply basic problem-solving and algorithmic reasoning to implement solutions.
- Use object-oriented programming to model problems with classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Handle common error conditions using exceptions and interfaces or abstract types where appropriate.
- Produce small to medium programs that are readable, maintainable, and testable.

**Prerequisites.** No formal prerequisites. Basic comfort with a computer is sufficient.

## Weekly structure

Each week provides:
1. A `README.md` summarizing the lecture topics and learning objectives,
2. Exercise prompts designed for a 2-hour lab session,
3. An assignment that is due in the following week.

## Course project

A small project will be completed at the end of the course. The project will require the application of object-oriented design, file handling, and basic error management. See the **[project](./project/)** folder when available.

## Notes

Materials are provided as-is. There may be mistakes, improvements are welcome through issues and pull requests.
