### Lecture 1: Inheritance and Polymorphism

#### 1. Inheritance

**Definition:** Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a class (child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent or superclass).

**Types of Inheritance in Python:**

* **Single Inheritance**: A child class inherits from one parent class.
* **Multiple Inheritance**: A child class inherits from more than one parent class.
* **Multilevel Inheritance**: A class inherits from a child class which in turn inherits from a parent class.
* **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple child classes inherit from one parent class.
* **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of two or more types of inheritance.

**Key Concepts:**

* `super()` function: Used to call the constructor, methods, and access data members from the parent class.

**Example:**

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name}.")

class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, student_id):
        super().__init__(name)  # Calling constructor of the parent class
        self.student_id = student_id

    def show_id(self):
        print(f"My ID is {self.student_id}.")

    def greet(self):
        super().greet()  # Calling method from the parent class
        print("I am also a student.")

# Usage
s = Student("Alice", "S123")
s.greet()         # Accessing parent method
s.show_id()       # Accessing subclass method
print(s.name)     # Accessing data member from parent class
```

* Overriding methods: A child class can provide its own implementation of methods defined in the parent class.

**Example:**

```python
class Vehicle:
    def start_engine(self):
        print("Starting the engine...")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def start_engine(self):
        print("Car engine starts with a key.")

# Usage
v = Vehicle()
v.start_engine()   # Output: Starting the engine...

c = Car()
c.start_engine()   # Output: Car engine starts with a key.
```

This demonstrates method overriding, where the `Car` class provides its own implementation of the `start_engine` method defined in the `Vehicle` class.

**Example 1: Single Inheritance**

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        print("Dog barks")

# Usage
d = Dog()
d.speak()
d.bark()
```

**Example 2: Multiple Inheritance**

```python
class Father:
    def skills(self):
        print("Gardening, Programming")

class Mother:
    def skills(self):
        print("Cooking, Art")

class Child(Father, Mother):
    def skills(self):
        print("Child's own skills:")
        super().skills()  # This will follow MRO (Method Resolution Order)
        print("Sports")

# Usage
c = Child()
c.skills()
```

**Explanation:**
In the example above, Python uses the Method Resolution Order (MRO) to decide which `skills()` method to call first when `super().skills()` is used. Since `Father` appears before `Mother` in the inheritance list of `Child`, `Father.skills()` is called.

**MRO of Child:**

```python
print(Child.__mro__)
# Output: (<class '__main__.Child'>, <class '__main__.Father'>, <class '__main__.Mother'>, <class 'object'>)
```

**UML Example: Multiple Inheritance**

```
  Father      Mother
     \         /
       \     /
        Child
```

**Example: Multilevel Inheritance**

```python
class Grandparent:
    def house(self):
        print("Grandparent's house")

class Parent(Grandparent):
    def car(self):
        print("Parent's car")

class Child(Parent):
    def bike(self):
        print("Child's bike")

# Usage
c = Child()
c.house()
c.car()
c.bike()
```

**UML: Multilevel Inheritance**

```
Grandparent
    |
  Parent
    |
  Child
```

**Example: Hierarchical Inheritance**

```python
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("Some generic animal sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Bark")

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Meow")

# Usage
animals = [Dog(), Cat()]
for animal in animals:
    animal.sound()
```

**UML: Hierarchical Inheritance**

```
     Animal
     /    \
   Dog    Cat
```

**Example: Hybrid Inheritance**

```python
class A:
    def method(self):
        print("Method from A")

class B(A):
    def method(self):
        print("Method from B")

class C:
    def method(self):
        print("Method from C")

class D(B, C):
    def method(self):
        super().method()  # Calls B.method() due to MRO
        print("Method from D")

# Usage
d = D()
d.method()
```

**UML: Hybrid Inheritance**

```
   A      C
    \    /
     B  /
      \/
       D
```

#### 2. Polymorphism

**Definition:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It mainly refers to the ability to call the same method on different objects and have each of them respond in their own way.

**Types of Polymorphism:**

* **Compile-time (Method Overloading)**: Not supported in Python directly, can be mimicked.
* **Runtime (Method Overriding)**: Supported through inheritance.

**Polymorphism in Other Languages: Java Example**

To understand how polymorphism is implemented in other programming languages, consider this Java example:

```java
// Base class Person
class Person {
  
    // Method that displays the 
    // role of a person
    void role() {
        System.out.println("I am a person.");
    }
}

// Derived class Father that 
// overrides the role method
class Father extends Person {
  
    // Overridden method to show 
    // the role of a father
    @Override
    void role() {
        System.out.println("I am a father.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      
        // Creating a reference of type Person 
        // but initializing it with Father class object
        Person p = new Father();
        
        // Calling the role method. It calls the 
        // overridden version in Father class
        p.role();  // Output: I am a father.
    }
}
```

**Comparison between Python and Java Polymorphism:**

| Feature            | Python                               | Java                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Method Overloading | Not natively supported               | Supported using method signatures  |
| Method Overriding  | Supported via inheritance            | Supported via inheritance          |
| Type Declaration   | Dynamic (no type declaration needed) | Static (type declaration required) |
| Super Keyword      | `super()`                            | `super` keyword                    |
|                    |                                      |                                    |

This comparison highlights that while Python supports polymorphism, it does so with more flexibility due to its dynamic typing, whereas Java enforces more structure through static typing and method signatures.

**Example 1: Runtime Polymorphism**

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Dog barks")

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Cat meows")

# Usage
for animal in [Dog(), Cat()]:
    animal.speak()
```

**Example 2: Polymorphism with Functions and Classes**

```python
def add(x, y, z=0):
    return x + y + z

print(add(2, 3))
print(add(2, 3, 4))
```

### Lecture 2: Exercises

**Exercise Set 1: Inheritance**

1. **Exercise 1**: Class Hierarchy with **`Person`**, **`Student`**, and **`Teacher`**

**Specification:**

* Base Class: `Person`

  * Attributes: `name`, `age`
  * Methods: `introduce()`
* Subclass: `Student`

  * Additional Attributes: `student_id`, `major`
  * Additional Methods: `study()`
* Subclass: `Teacher`

  * Additional Attributes: `employee_id`, `subject`
  * Additional Methods: `teach()`

**Diagram:**

```
          Person
           /   \
     Student   Teacher
```

2. Extend the above example to use `super()` and override the `introduce()` method in `Student`. The overridden method should call the base class version of `introduce()` using `super()`, then print an additional message specific to the student.
3. Add a new class `Staff` and demonstrate multiple inheritance by combining `Person` and `Staff` into a new subclass `Teacher`.

**Specification:**

* Class: `Staff`

  * Attributes: `department`, `salary`
  * Methods: `display_staff_info()`
* Class: `Teacher` (inherits from both `Person` and `Staff`)

  * Attributes: `employee_id`, `subject` (in addition to inherited ones)
  * Methods: `teach()` and override `introduce()`

**UML Diagram:**

```
  Person    Staff
     \       /
     Teacher
```

**Exercise Set 2: Polymorphism**

**Specification of Classes:**

* **Base Class**: **`Shape`**

  * **Attributes:** None (acts as an abstract base class)
  * **Methods:** `area()` - meant to be overridden in subclasses

* **Subclass**: **`Circle`**

  * **Attributes:** `radius`
  * **Methods:** Overrides `area()` to return the area using Ï€ * r^2

* **Subclass**: **`Square`**

  * **Attributes:** `side`
  * **Methods:** Overrides `area()` to return the area using side^2

* **Subclass**: **`Rectangle`**

  * **Attributes:** `length`, `width`
  * **Methods:** Overrides `area()` to return the area using length * width

These classes demonstrate polymorphism through overriding the `area()` method in a way that reflects the behavior of each geometric shape.

1. Create a base class `Shape` with a method `area()`. Implement it in `Circle`, `Square`, and `Rectangle`.
2. Implement a function `describe_shape(shape)` that accepts any shape and prints its area and type.
3. Using the `Shape` classes, create a polymorphic list and iterate over it.

**Shape Hierarchy:**

```
         Shape
        /  |   \
 Circle Square Rectangle
```

### Assignment: Vending Machine Simulation Using Inheritance and Polymorphism

**Assignment Instructions:**
Design and implement a Python program simulating a vending machine using inheritance and polymorphism. Define a base class `Product` and derive multiple product types from it, each overriding relevant methods.

**Class Design:**

* Base Class: **`Product`**

  * Attributes: `name`, `price`
  * Method: `display_info()` â€“ displays basic product details.

* **Subclasses:**

  * `Drink`: adds attribute `volume`, overrides `display_info()`
  * `Snack`: adds attribute `calories`, overrides `display_info()`
  * `Candy`: adds attribute `flavor`, overrides `display_info()`

**UML Diagram:**

```
        Product
       /   |    \
   Drink Snack Candy
```

**Runtime Behavior Example:**

**Extended Feature â€“ Loading Products from a File:**
To simulate a realistic vending machine, extend the program to load products from a file.

**Example File Structure (****`products.txt`****):**

```
Drink,Cola,1.50,500
Snack,Chips,2.00,250
Candy,Gummy Bears,1.20,Strawberry
Drink,Water,1.00,600
Snack,Cookies,1.75,300
```

Each line contains: `Type,Name,Price,Attribute`

* For `Drink`: the last value is volume in ml
* For `Snack`: the last value is calories
* For `Candy`: the last value is flavor

**Student Task:**

* Parse this file line by line
* Create the correct object (`Drink`, `Snack`, or `Candy`) based on the type
* Store all objects in a list
* Show a menu based on the loaded products

**Expected Menu Output:**

```
Welcome to the Python Vending Machine!

Please select what you want:
1. Drink - Cola
2. Snack - Chips
3. Candy - Gummy Bears
4. Drink - Water
5. Snack - Cookies

> 1

Product Information:
Product: Cola, Price: $1.50
Volume: 500ml
```

**Hint for Students:**
Use `open()`, `readlines()` or `csv.reader` to process the file. Implement a simple factory method or conditional logic to instantiate the correct subclass.

```
Welcome to the Python Vending Machine!

Please select what you want:
1. Drink
2. Candy
3. Snack

> 1

Product Information:
Product: Cola, Price: $1.50
Volume: 500ml
```

**Note:**
You must:

* Use inheritance and polymorphism.
* Use `super()` to reuse the base class methods.
* Override `display_info()` in each subclass.
* Present the user with a menu and respond accordingly.
