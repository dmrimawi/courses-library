## Lecture 1: Functions and File Handling in Python

### Lecture Goals

* Understand the importance of modularity through functions.
* Learn function types, definitions, parameters, return values, and scope.
* Understand recursion and how functions can call other functions.
* Learn how to handle file input and output operations in Python.

### Topic 1: Introduction to Functions

**What is a function and why we need it?**
A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It helps reduce redundancy and improves code clarity.

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, welcome to Python!")

greet()
```

### Topic 2: Function Definitions and Types

**Function without parameters and no return:**

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

**Function with parameters but no return:**

```python
def greet_user(name):
    print("Hello,", name)

greet_user("Ali")
```

**Function with parameters and a return value:**

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(3, 5)
print(result)
```

**Function without parameters but with return:**

```python
def get_number():
    return 42

print(get_number())
```

### Topic 3: Function Calls and Recursion

**Function calling another function:**

```python
def square(x):
    return x * x

def print_square(y):
    print("Square is:", square(y))

print_square(4)
```

**Recursive function (e.g., factorial):**

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))
```

### Topic 4: Bubble Sort as a Function

**Sorting an array using bubble sort:** This function takes a list of numbers and sorts them in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]

numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
bubble_sort(numbers)
print("Sorted array:", numbers)
```

### Topic 5: Local and Global Variables

**Local vs Global Example:**

```python
x = 10  # global variable

def func():
    x = 5  # local variable
    print("Local x:", x)

func()
print("Global x:", x)
```

**Modifying global variable inside function:**

```python
count = 0

def increment():
    global count
    count += 1

increment()
print(count)
```

### Topic 6: Files in Python

**Writing to a file:**

```python
with open("data.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello File\n")
    f.write("Python I/O")
```

**Reading from a file:**

```python
import os

if os.path.exists("data.txt"):
    with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
        content = f.read()
        print(content)
else:
    print("File does not exist.")
```

**Appending to a file:**

```python
with open("data.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write("\nAppended line")
```

## Lecture 2: Practical Python Exercises

### Lecture Goals

* Reinforce programming fundamentals through practice.
* Encourage problem solving and structured thinking.

### Exercise 1: Temperature Converter

* Write a function that takes a Celsius temperature and returns the Fahrenheit equivalent.
* Use input/output functions and function call.
* Save the result to a file.

### Exercise 2: Grade Evaluator

* Read a list of student marks from a file (one mark per line).
* Calculate the average of the class.
* Display the average on the screen.

### Exercise 3: Number Statistics

* Let the user enter a list of integers.
* Use loops to find max, min, count positives/negatives.
* Display summary in the console and write it to a file.

### Exercise 4: Login System

* Predefine usernames and passwords.
* Use a loop to validate user input.
* Use a function for validation.
* Log login attempts to a file.

### Exercise 5: Recursive Calculator

* Implement a recursive function to calculate the power of a number (e.g., a^b).
* Create a menu that allows the user to choose to calculate power, square, or exit.

## Assignments (Individual)

### Assignment 1: Word Counter

* Ask the user for a file name.
* Count and display the number of words in the file.
* Identify the most frequent word and how many times it appears.

### Assignment 2: Prime Number Analyzer

* Let the user input a range of numbers.
* Use a function to check if a number is prime.
* Write all prime numbers in that range to a file, one per line.
